This project was developed on MacOS 10.12 using Safari 10.0.

To move the robot, use the 'f', 'b', 'l', and 'r' keys. 'f' and 'b' move the robot forward (up) and backward (down) while 'l' and 'r' move it left and right.
Holding the shift key with any of these will slow the robot's movement down.

Click and drag the mouse to rotate your selected piece of the robot (select a different piece by clicking one of the buttons below the canvas).

The 'c' key will change the robot to a random color.
