This project was developed on MacOS 10.12 using Safari 10.0.

To move the robot, use the 'f', 'b', 'l', and 'r' keys. 'f' and 'b' move the robot forward and backward while 'l' and 'r' move it left and right and 'u' and 'd' move it up and down.
Holding the shift key with any of these will slow the robot's movement down.

Click and drag the mouse to rotate the entire scene (select a piece of the robot by clicking one of the buttons below the canvas).

A right click-drag will scale the scene no matter which piece of the robot is selected.

The camera control buttons control the camera position and angle.
